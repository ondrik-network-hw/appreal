The Netbench Framework
==========================

The Netbench Framework consists of several experimental subdirectories where each project stores its specific libraries and tests. There is a common library in common directory. In order to be able to use this library you have to source a setup.sh script.


Download
--------
Netbench can be downloaded at www.fit.vutbr.cz/netbench


Installation
------------
Python 2.x is required to run Netbench. To set the environment variables, run

. setup.sh

(Make sure you include the dot-space at the beginning.)
If you wish to set environment variables for netbench into system permanently, please follow the instruction printed by the setup.sh script.

Some libraries may be further dependent on third party libraries. If so, such specific dependencies are described in README in subdirectories for each set of algorithms.

Contributions
-------------
Send your patches, new algorithms, datasets etc. to netbench@fit.vutbr.cz. After review, these patches will be added to the framework.


Documentation
-------------
netbench.pdf is a motivation document, highlighting some features of Netbench.

design.pdf is a design document, describing some technical details of Netbench.

The documentation generated by the Doxygen-like Sphinx tool can be found in doc/index.html file.


Citations
---------
