PCRESYNTAX(3)                                                    PCRESYNTAX(3)


NAME
       PCRE - Perl-compatible regular expressions


PCRE REGULAR EXPRESSION SYNTAX SUMMARY

       The  full syntax and semantics of the regular expressions that are sup-
       ported by PCRE are described in  the  pcrepattern  documentation.  This
       document contains just a quick-reference summary of the syntax.


QUOTING

         \x         where x is non-alphanumeric is a literal x
         \Q...\E    treat enclosed characters as literal


CHARACTERS

         \a         alarm, that is, the BEL character (hex 07)
         \cx        "control-x", where x is any character
         \e         escape (hex 1B)
         \f         formfeed (hex 0C)
         \n         newline (hex 0A)
         \r         carriage return (hex 0D)
         \t         tab (hex 09)
         \ddd       character with octal code ddd, or backreference
         \xhh       character with hex code hh
         \x{hhh..}  character with hex code hhh..


CHARACTER TYPES

         .          any character except newline;
                      in dotall mode, any character whatsoever
         \C         one byte, even in UTF-8 mode (best avoided)
         \d         a decimal digit
         \D         a character that is not a decimal digit
         \h         a horizontal whitespace character
         \H         a character that is not a horizontal whitespace character
         \p{xx}     a character with the xx property
         \P{xx}     a character without the xx property
         \R         a newline sequence
         \s         a whitespace character
         \S         a character that is not a whitespace character
         \v         a vertical whitespace character
         \V         a character that is not a vertical whitespace character
         \w         a "word" character
         \W         a "non-word" character
         \X         an extended Unicode sequence

       In PCRE, \d, \D, \s, \S, \w, and \W recognize only ASCII characters.

         (?R)            recurse whole pattern
         (?n)            call subpattern by absolute number
         (?+n)           call subpattern by relative number

         (?(n)...        absolute reference condition
         (?(+n)...       relative reference condition
         (?(-n)...       relative reference condition
         (?(<name>)...   named reference condition (Perl)
         (?('name')...   named reference condition (Perl)

         (?(DEFINE)...   define subpattern for reference
         (?(assert)...   assertion condition


BACKTRACKING CONTROL

       The following act immediately they are reached:

         (*ACCEPT)       force successful match
         (*FAIL)         force backtrack; synonym (*F)

       The  following  act only when a subsequent match failure causes a back-
       track to reach them. They all force a match failure, but they differ in
       what happens afterwards. Those that advance the start-of-match point do
       so only if the pattern is not anchored.

         (*COMMIT)       overall failure, no advance of starting point
         (*PRUNE)        advance to next starting character
         (*SKIP)         advance start to current matching position
         (*THEN)         local failure, backtrack to next alternation


NEWLINE CONVENTIONS

       These are recognized only at the very start of the pattern or  after  a
       (*BSR_...) or (*UTF8) option.

         (*CR)           carriage return only
         (*LF)           linefeed only
         (*CRLF)         carriage return followed by linefeed
         (*ANYCRLF)      all three of the above
         (*ANY)          any Unicode newline sequence


WHAT \R MATCHES

       These  are  recognized only at the very start of the pattern or after a
       (*...) option that sets the newline convention or UTF-8 mode.

         (*BSR_ANYCRLF)  CR, LF, or CRLF
         (*BSR_UNICODE)  any Unicode newline sequence


CALLOUTS

         (?C)      callout
         (?Cn)     callout with data n
